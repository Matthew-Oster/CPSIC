# CPSIC
Files for the Coronavirus Pandemic System Integrated Control

Jake Davis - As we work together to analyze and design our software, I feel incredibly good about the steps were taking. It feels like we're finally putting everything we learned to use. I have no problems with my group, as they're all talented and hard working, although it was easier to manage things when we could meet up. However, the remote development presents a very real life challenge that most of us will likely have to deal with in our future careers, and is a very learnable experience.

Matthew Oster - The vision for the CPSIC becomes clearer and clearer the further into development we get, and the architecture seems to be evolving naturally into a more stable state. The inclusion of Bill and coronaInfo into systemAccess occured rather late in development (around April 1 I believe), which goes to show how important it is for an architecture to be flexible. In regards to how the work was broken up, I was responsible for the Statistics, coronaInfo, and systemAccess files, as well as the data dictionary, modelling the “Log New Patient”, “Visualize Information”,  “Update Throughout Network”, “Update Statistics”, and “Generate Alert" use cases, the use case diagram, and the revised class diagrams with operations, attributes, and descriptions. I think our team worked together pretty well, though things did get more difficult after the situation forced us to work remotely. As Jake said, remote development will likely become familiar to us going forward, so I consider it a good learning experience.
